CamelJunk code
=================

This project was written during the completion of JB421 to implement, test, and play with Camel concepts
The course examples use outdated versions of Fuse products that have, in some cases changed drastically.
I reimplemented equivalent camel concepts during completion of the course to manually work with the data
types and integration patterns.

This package is intended to be a repository of WORKING CODE, so that anyone can reference their own implementation
with this repo if they encounter problems

Individual java classes will have comments at the top indicating their purpose and relevant section from the course.



You will need to compile this example first:
  mvn install

To run the example type
  mvn clean package exec:java
